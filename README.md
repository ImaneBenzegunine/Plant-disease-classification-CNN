# Plant Disease Classification using CNN

A deep learning project that classifies plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This model can distinguish between healthy plants and those affected by powdery mildew (oïdium) or rust (rouille).

## Key Features
- 🖼️ Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- 🧠 Custom CNN architecture with 92% test accuracy
- 📊 Training visualization and model evaluation
- 🚀 Ready-to-use prediction system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/ImaneBenzegunine/Plant-disease-classification-CNN
   cd plant-disease-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy pillow
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset contains images of plants in three categories:
- Healthy
- Powdery Mildew (Oïdium)
- Rust (Rouille)

```

## Training the Model

The CNN architecture consists of:
- 4 Convolutional layers with MaxPooling
- 512-neuron Dense layer with Dropout
- 3-neuron output layer (softmax)

To train the model:
```python
python src/train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
```

## Results
